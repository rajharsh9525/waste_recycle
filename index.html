    <h1>Welcome To Our Website</h1><p>where we believe in the power of responsible waste management. <br>Our mission is to make a positive impact on the environment by <br>providing you with the tools and information needed to dispose of<br>
         waste responsibly and embrace sustainable living.<br>Together, let's pave the way for a cleaner and greener future."</p></div>
    <div class="para1">
        <p><b>We are in the midst of a chronic waste crisis. Despite renewed commitments by businesses and policymakers to support the transition to a <br>
         circular economy, we are polluting our world at a rate higher than ever before.</b> The circular economy demands recycled material, yet many cities struggle with overflowing landfills, informal dumping and burning of waste, and are unable to recover the valuable resources from their waste streams. Why is it that some cities’ efforts to increase recycling rates barely make a dent in waste flows, while others make steady, ultimately transformative progress towards their zero-waste vision? What makes the difference? Delterra’s experience has shown that to be successful at scale, cities need to take an integrated, holistic approach to designing their waste management systems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="para2">
        <p><b>To support cities in making smart investments to divert their waste into the circular economy, Delterra has defined six interdependent dimensions of a holistic integrated waste management system.</b> This framework is intended to break down the ambiguity of the circular economy transition for the waste management and recycling space, as these are two of the circular economy domains over which a city has the greatest control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="para3">
        In this framework, three dimensions are performance drivers, which ensure that the process of managing waste and maximizing recovery back into productive use is efficiently and effectively delivered. These include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Generation & Source Separation</b> – supporting residents and businesses to separate their waste into relevant streams for collection through education and engagement, enabling material value to be preserved during the collection process</li>
            <li><b>Collection, Sorting & Treatment</b> – ensuring dependable and economical operations of the collection, sorting and treatment systems to ensure that waste streams are effectively kept separate and efficiently put back into productive use</li>
            <li><b>Offtake & Market Demand</b> – securing offtake opportunities for recyclable or compostable materials with consistent demand and fair pricing to help stabilize the overall system</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="para4">
        The three remaining dimensions are performance enablers, which form the foundation for ongoing success by ensuring the necessary coordination, resources, expertise and incentives consistently over time. These include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strategy & Budget</b> – providing a long-term vision for implementation of circular economy, including detailed insights into waste management economics</li>
            <li><b>Policies & Regulations</b> – creating supportive policies that incentivize the circular economy and ensure that standards are in place for ongoing system management</li>
            <li><b>Capabilities & Partnerships </b>– ensuring development and coordination of necessary talent and partnerships to support waste management, as well as tracking and reporting of key system metrics.</li>
        </ul>
